                About Anne
            </h3>
            <p>
                Anne is a simple woman - loving and kind.
                She likes to bake goods all of the time.<br/>
                One late winter night, as snow fell from the sky,
                she whipped up a new batch, and gave it a try.<br/>
                The recipe was old, crinkled and tattered,
                but yielded some of the most thick, luscious batter.<br/>
                The oven was hot, the preparations were made,
                and the oven was closed right after the tray.<br/>
                The kitchen was cleaned and the timer was set,
                this would be the batch she'd never forget.<br/>
                The timer went off at the midnight hour,
                and as the bell rung she was bestowed with an ungodly power!<br/>
                It was the birth of the Good Good, the sweetest of treats,
                the Goods are so good we parade through the streets!<br/>
                How the Goods are so good, no one trudy knows,
                but with every bite, one's cravings will grow!<br/>
                How can you know just how good it will be?
                Well, the doors are always open at Anne's Goodery.<br/>
            </p>
